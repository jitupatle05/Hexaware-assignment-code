# HexawareAssignment2

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.17.

# Important notes about the code
"I Have tried to implement all possible given scenario in this time frame, I have other commitments to do and parallarly giving interviews to get the job, "

Now coming to the code-
My first step was to break the UX into reusable domains — works listing, filtering, navigation, and contact and form — and then design a clean separation between pages, containers, and presentational components.

From there, I focused on reusability, performance, and maintainability, using Angular 17, and also used some latest features like Signals.

The goal was that the same components could use in the landing page, works page, or any other feature page without duplicating logic.

In terms of designing part(CSS) i tried to implement multiple ways to write css as well as in SCSS syntex,
I have tried to explain how write Variables in SCSS, how can we use encapsulation, reusable CSS code,
how can we acheive responsivenes - 
Used 3 ways- 1. By usinhg Bootstrap
             2. By using Flex/Grid layou
             3. By using media queries
